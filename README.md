# Crime Data Analysis & Prediction Project

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes crime data across different Indian states and years.
It also includes a simple machine learning model to predict crime counts
based on year, state, and crime type.

The dataset used is synthetically generated for academic purposes.

##  Exploratory Data Analysis
- Year-wise crime trend analysis
- State-wise crime comparison
- Crime-type distribution analysis

---

##  Machine Learning Model
- Algorithm Used: Linear Regression
- Target Variable: Crime_Count
- Evaluation Metrics: R² Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Note: Since the dataset is synthetically generated, model accuracy is not the primary focus.

##  Academic Note
This project is created as a **college mini project** to demonstrate:
- Data analysis workflow
- Visualization
- Basic machine learning pipeline
- Model saving and reuse
